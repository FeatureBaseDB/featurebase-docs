Putting it all together

## Mapping data types

Need to include:
* list of data types and destination types and how they map
* IDEAL - recontextualise the size-fb-database and data type stuff from overview-data-modeling to give users an idea of space and requirements
* links to child overviews for set/setq
* links to examples of how it works
