# How do I connect to my FeatureBase Cloud database?

There are several methods to connect to your database:

* via the web portal
* via REST API calls used in applications
* via FBSQL, a command-line SQL tool you can install on a local Linux or MacOS machine

## Before you begin
{: .no_toc }
{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}

## Connect via the web portal

* [Learn how to sign-in via the Web portal](/docs/cloud/cloud-login)

The Cloud API allows two methods to authenticate with your FeatureBase Cloud database:

* [Cloud API security JWT access token](https://api-docs-featurebase-cloud.redoc.ly/latest#section/Security){:target="_blank"}
* [Cloud API key](/docs/cloud/cloud-authentication/cloud-auth-manage)
