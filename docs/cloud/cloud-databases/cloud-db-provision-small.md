There are two ways to create a small database that is useful for testing purposes and small projects of less than 8GB of data.

{% include page-toc.md %}

## Before you begin

{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}

### Method one - provision the database with an auto-generated name

{% include /cloud/homepage-db-create-options.md %} under **Start with a small database**
