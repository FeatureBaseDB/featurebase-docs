# How do I quickly evaluate FeatureBase at scale?
{: .no_toc }

The FeatureBase sample dataset contains 1 billion customer records with attributes that are commonly used for customer segmentation.

There are two ways to create the database which takes approximately 10 minutes to provision.

{% include page-toc.md %}

## Before you begin

{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}

## Provision a billion record database

You can create the database in two ways.

## Method one - create the database with an auto-generated name

* Click **Home** then **CREATE** under **Start with a billion records**

## Method two - create the database with a custom name

{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-new-name.md %}
{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-load-sample.md %}
{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-click-create.md %}

## Next step

* [Query sample data](/docs/cloud/cloud-query/cloud-query-data)
