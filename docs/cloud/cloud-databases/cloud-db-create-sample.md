{: .no_toc }

This procedure explains how to create a database loaded with sample data you can query immediately.

Our sample dataset contains 1 billion customer records with attributes that are commonly used for customer segmentation.

It will take approximately 10 minutes to create the database.

NOTE: You can also [create a database of your own](/docs/cloud/cloud-databases/cloud-db-create) then create tables and add data.

{% include page-toc.md %}

## Before you begin

{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}

## Create database with pre-loaded data

{% include /cloud/cloud-db-new-name.md %}
{% include /cloud/cloud-db-load-sample.md %}
{% include /cloud/cloud-db-click-create.md %}
