## What are the benefits of Serverless databases?

### Scaling the database with Workers

A Serverless database can be scaled up or down using the `ALTER DATABASE` statement to add or remove **Workers** from the database.

A worker has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Additional information |
|---|---|---|
| Resources | 2GB of memory and 1x vCPU | 0 to 8 workers can be assigned to any Serverless database |
| Purpose | Handle computation and transpiling of queries and data |  |

**Workers** can be granted or revoked:
* without losing data
* without the need to spin the database down

### Database storage

Serverless Databases have storage with 11 nines of durability, plus:
* higher availability and durability for your data
* Redundant storage across multiple locations (highly available to Workers)

## What are the limitations of Serverless databases?

{% include /cloud-db/serverless-preview-limitations.md %}

## How are Serverless databases priced?

Compute and storage usage is charged separately based on usage.
