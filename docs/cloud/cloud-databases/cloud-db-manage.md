# How do I manage databases in FeatureBase Cloud?
{: .no_toc }

When you login to FeatureBase for the first time, or have deleted all databases, you're offered three choices for a first database:

* **Start with a small database** which is suitable for small projects or testing
* **Create sample database** which contains terabytes of data you can use to test if FeatureBase meets your expectations
* **Create custom database** that meets your specific needs

{: .note}
You can also [create a database using the Cloud API](#create-database-using-the-cloud-api).
