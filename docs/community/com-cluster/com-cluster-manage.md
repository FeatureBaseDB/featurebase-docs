# How do I setup a FeatureBase Community cluster?

A FeatureBase Cluster allows you to distribute your data and resources across three or more separate environments.

## Before you begin
{% include /com-install/com-install-before-begin.md %}

## Setup a cluster

* [Learn how to setup a FeatureBase cluster](/docs/community/com-cluster/com-cluster-setup)

## Resize cluster

FeatureBase clusters cannot be resized. However, they can be scaled by backing-up then restoring to a newer, larger cluster.

* [Learn about FeatureBase backup and restore](/docs/community/com-backup/com-backup-home)

## Change cluster `partition-to-node-assignment`

* [Safely change cluster partition-to-node-assignment](/docs/community/com-cluster-change-partition-node)

## Cluster metrics

Cluster metrics are a subset of FeatureBase metrics.
