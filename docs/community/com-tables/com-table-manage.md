## How do I create and manage tables in FeatureBase Community?

FeatureBase Community provides a UI which displays tables and their structure.

Tables can be created:
* using SQL queries run via a number of methods
* via data import operations

## Before you begin

{% include /com-install/com-install-before-begin.md %}
* [SQL statements](/docs/sql-guide/statements/statements-home)

## Query methods

Run Table statements and other SQL queries against your database using the following methods:

{% include /community/com-sql-query-run.md %}

## Data import

Tables can be created using CLI ingest consumers which are configured with table structure and data to insert.
