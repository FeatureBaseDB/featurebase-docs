Data mapped to `SET` and `SETQ` data types are:
* identified by a single unique value
* imported as comma-separated values
* to a single column and row

This method:
* overcomes the need to normalize data into separate tables
* reduces the number of rows imported

The data can be queried individually or as a range of values.
