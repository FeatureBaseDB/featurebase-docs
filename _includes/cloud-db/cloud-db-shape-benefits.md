## What are the benefits of a shaped database?

In general, shaped databases have:
* overprovisioned disk space and memory to ensure best performance
* data replication should a node go down.

### Predefined resources

CPU and memory resources are bundled for easier billing. Choose an appropriate shape for your requirements:

| Resource | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|
| Memory | 32GB | 2TB |
| Disk storage | 100GB | 2TB |
| Virtual CPU | 12 | 576 |
