### TOML connection file

A `filename.toml` connection file can be saved in the `*/fbsql/featurebase` directory or in an accessible file path.

Valid connection files have:
* a valid combination of arguments and values in form `argument = "value"`,
* on individual lines,
* with leading `--` and trailing `\` omitted.
