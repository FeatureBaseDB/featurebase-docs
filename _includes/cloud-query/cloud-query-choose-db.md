There are two methods for defining the database you want to query:

|Method | Instructions  |
| --- | ----------- |
| Database Dropdown | Click the dropdown in the top right labeled **Database** and select your database. This will default to the database most recently created |
| Query alias | You can ignore the dropdown selection and direct any query to a particular database by aliasing/prepending the query with `“{<database name>}”`. example: `{my_db}select 1`  |
