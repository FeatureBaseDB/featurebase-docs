At a high level, copying data to FeatureBase indexes is a data transformation process. It is possible to make an identical copy of your RDBMS tables and transfer data to FeatureBase, but for added benefits, you can choose to restructure your data to make queries more efficient.

Data modeling involves planning the most efficient approach for your needs, including:
* Determining what you need to learn from your queries
* Assessing the data to export and mapping to FeatureBase data types
* Experimenting to get the best results
