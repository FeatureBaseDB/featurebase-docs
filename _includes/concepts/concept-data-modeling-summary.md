Data modeling in FeatureBase involves:
* identifying the issues you're experiencing with your source data
* identifying the data to import and the unique key for each row
* mapping data types, including those that handle high-cardinality data
* choosing a method to import your data
* creating the destination
* running the import
* testing the outcome
* fixing issues that may have occurred
