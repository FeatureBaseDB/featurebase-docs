## Step 2 - Download the release

Right-click the appropriate release on the GitHub releases page, then download to your `/downloads` directory.

Alternatively, you can download using the terminal.

* Open a terminal
* CD to the `/downloads` directory
* Use the correct values for `<version>`, `<kernel>` and `<processor>` in the following command:

```
curl -L https://github.com/FeatureBaseDB/featurebase/releases/download/v<version>/featurebase-v<version>-<kernel>-<processor>64.tar.gz -o featurebase.tgz
```
