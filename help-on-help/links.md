# Hyperlinks

Hyperlink colours (including those in navigation bars) are governed by the `$link-color` setting in `featurebase.scss`.

| Type of link | Structure | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Internal | `[meaningful-anchor-text](/docs/folder/filename)` | `[Learn how to create tables in FeatureBase cloud](/docs/cloud/cloud-tables/cloud-table-create)` |
| External | `[meaningful-anchor-text](https://url){:target="_blank"}` | [Visit the FeatureBase website](https://featurebase.com){:target="_blank"} |

WARNING: `[meaningful-anchor-text]` means **more than one word**. Single-word anchor text is **useless** for search and for users trying to find information on a page. It's also a throwback to 1998.
