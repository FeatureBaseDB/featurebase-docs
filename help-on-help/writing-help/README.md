# Writing help README

This folder contains writing guidance to make FeatureBase docs:

* Consistent
* Easy to understand

## Plan your content

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. This goes double for documentation because it tends to be *set-and-forget* which leads to confusing, convoluted and repetitive content.

* [Planning your content](/help-on-help/writing-help/writing-planning-content.md)
* [Writing modular content](/help-on-help/writing-help/writing-modular-content.md)
* [Reusing content with Jekyll `include` files](/help-on-help/writing-help/writing-common-include.md)

## Writing rules
