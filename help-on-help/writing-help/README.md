# Writing help README

This folder contains writing guidance to make FeatureBase docs:

* Consistent
* Easy to understand

* [Writing modular content](/help-on-help/writing-help/writing-modular-content)
* [Reusing content with Jekyll `include` files](/help-on-help/writing-help/writing-common-include)
