# Content callouts

Highlight important information sparingly with Callout boxes.

**WARNING** -- Engineers using old-style text highlights, warnings, notes, etc will be directed to use the new styles listed below.

Colors are governed by `/_sass/color_schemes/featurebase.scss`

* [Learn about callout boxes](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components/callouts/)

## Note callout

The **Note** Callout gives useful information for a given context. Where possible, list this information under the [**Before you begin** standard heading](/help-on-help/style-guide/standard-headings)

```
<p class="note">This is a note callout</p>

# Or use

{: .note }
This is a note callout

```

## Warning callout

**Warnings** are given to warn of imminent danger and/or consequences of performing certain actions. For example, deleting a table.

```
<p class="warning">This is a warning callout</p>

# Or use

{: .warning }
This is a warning callout

```

## Success callout

**Success** is used infrequently but is available if required.

```
<p class="success">Q'PLA! This is a success callout with a joke because it's that time of the day.</p>

Or use

{: .success }
Q'PLA! This is a success callout with a joke because it's that time of the day.

```

## Important callout

**Important** information covers anything the user **absolutely** needs to be aware of in a given context. Ordinarily this information would be covered under the [**Before you begin** standard heading](/help-on-help/style-guide/standard-headings)

```
<p class="important">AWOOGAH! This is something important!</p>

# or use

{: .important}
AWOOGAH! This is something important!

```
