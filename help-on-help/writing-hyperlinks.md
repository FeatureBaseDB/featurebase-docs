# Writing hyperlinks

In short, writing meaningful anchor text for a hyperlink:
* helps give context to what's on the other end of the link
* makes hyperlinks more visible and clearer in text
* are more likely to be indexed because they'll invariably feature a keyword

On the other hand, single word anchor text is sub-optimal, especially if you use the same word over and over again.

| Example | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| "...click [here](#) for information on Tables..."<br/>"...learn more about the process [here](#)..." | It's harder to see a single hyperlink in a block of text, which means users will miss them. | [Learn about tables](#) |

## Other issues with single-word hyperlinks

* No-one searches on a single word unless it's a recognised keyword (which itself can be > 1 word), therefore things like `click [here](#)` are useless
* Single words won't be indexed in search so that again makes information harder to find.
