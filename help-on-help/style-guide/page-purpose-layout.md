# Page purpose and layout

There are seven types of page to choose from, each with a specific purpose and layout

| Purpose | Description | Example layout |
|---|---|---|
| Overviews | High level overview of concepts or functionality. Contain **NO** process or procedural steps. Ideally you will have a "parent" overview for the really high-level information, and multiple "child" overviews to drill down into more detailed content. And from there you can link to subpages listed below. | Parent overview -- `index.md`<br/> Child overview -- `/docs/cloud/cloud-databases/cloud-db-manage.md` |
| Process | A list of tasks that provide general information without delving into functionality | `/help-on-help/publishing-workflow/deployment-process.md` |
| Procedure | Specific list of functional steps to perform to complete a **single** task in a **specific** area of the application. | `/docs/cloud/cloud-tables/cloud-table-create.md` |
| Procedure series | A set of procedures that guide the user through an end-to-end use case. Constructed so individual procedures can be reused for other purposes | Community setup on Windows is a good example<br/> Part one -- `/docs/community/com-install-windows.md`<br/> Part two -- `/docs/community/com-install-linux.md` (which can **also** be performed in isolation) |
| FAQ | Frequently asked questions kept to a minimal answer and/or link to another file which contains the correct answers. These **must** be confined to a single area of functionality. Endless scroll FAQs make content hard for users to follow. | `/docs/concepts/glossary.md` |
| Issue | known issues which contain a description of the issue, the probable cause and workarounds or solutions. | Docs in `/docs/cloud/cloud-troubleshooting.md` |
| Reference | Specifically structured reference content | Docs found under `/docs/sql-guide` |
