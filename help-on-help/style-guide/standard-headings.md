# Standard headings

We use standard headings to consistently describe content.

| Heading | Used for | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Before you begin | The ultimate goal of this heading is to tell the user:<br/>* What they need to know before moving forward<br/>* What they need to have done before they get here<br/>Ultimately this is a list of prerequisites and requirements | `/docs/community/com-startup-connect` |
| Step N - <description> | Used to gather a series of steps into a context so the user knows they must be completed before moving forward. Especially useful if a group of steps requires some explanation before they are performed |
| Further information | Related information to the content on the page which will likely include links to other FeatureBase documentation, and also external links which seem useful |
| Next step | Used for Procedure series to direct user to the next page in the sequence, and also to direct the user to something else they might choose to do (e.g., after loading data, they might want to query it) |
| Syntax | May be prefixed with DDL or other specifics, but what follows is the standard syntax used to construct commands, sql, etc. NOT BNF diagrams which are their own thing | `/docs/sql-guide/statements/statement-insert` |
| Arguments | May be called something else based on the context (e.g., Flags for CLI commands) but describe the syntax provided in a table form | `/docs/community/com-ingest/com-ingest-flags-csv` |
| Examples | Usually found in reference docs and used for real-life examples of how the command/sql is used | `/docs/sql-guide/functions/function-rtrim` |
