## Terminology and word usage

| Word | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | This is a noun, describing a thing, not an action | Python Client Library setup guide |
| Set up | This is a verb, describing an action | How do I set up FeatureBase Cloud? |

## Phrasing to avoid

Never do these

| Phrasing | Issue | Suggested alternative |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Language | This actually says "Structured Query Language Language" which is a tautology, saying the same thing twice | SQL |
| PQL Language | The same as above "Pilosa Query Language Language" | PQL |
