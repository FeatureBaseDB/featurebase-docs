# Writing content for FeatureBase docs

Some rules for writing content to make life easier for yourself **and** the users.

## Write content in plain English

Plain English makes the content easier to understand and follow for native speakers and users with English as an additional language.

For example:

| Rule | Informal English | Problem | Plain English |
|---|---|---|---|
| If it's important enough to write, it's important enough to make it clear. | "...If you are the inquisitive type, you may be interested in the [architectural overview]()..." | It’s not possible to tell if this is required information or something that’s only important to specific people. | System Administrators can find further information in the [architectural overview](URL) |
| Write clear, unambiguous instructions | "...but if you’d rather look at the finished tutorial, please see the [full source code]().." | Unclear, long-winded instruction. | [Learn more about <task/tutorial>](URL) |
| Get to the point; Help is not a conversation | "...As you work through the guide, please note any questions or feedback that you may have for the FeatureBase team. We’re always looking for ways to improve the experience!..." | Documentation is different to a verbal tutorial. It’s direct, factual and accurate because it’s going to be used by a user to complete specific tasks.<br/>You can be chatty and informal in Slack conversations or face-to-face but not in documentation. | **Further support**<br/> [Contact FeatureBase support with questions or issues](#) |
| Tell users what to expect BEFORE providing examples | [EXAMPLE CODE BLOCK]<br/>Above, bind tells FeatureBase to listen for HTTP request on all IPv4 addresses on the local machine at port 10101. | Telling a user what to expect after they’ve done it is like signing a contract without reading it. | Break this down into syntax, then explain arguments, then provide an example |
