# Local build

Two methods are available to run a local build of the `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` site.

* Docker
* Virtual Machine

**IMPORTANT** We do **not** recommend installing Ruby and Jekyll on your operating system as gemfile conflicts **will occur**, ESPECIALLY if you've already setup for the old help repository `/molecula/documantion`

## Before you begin

* Setup Git (including user name and password)
* Add SSH keys to your GitHub account
* Request Read/Write access to `featurebase/featurebase-docs` if you do not already have it
* Clone `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` repository

## Local build using Docker

* [local build with docker](/help-on-help/local-build-with-docker.md)

## Local build using a Virtual Machine

* [local build with VM](/help-on-help/local-build-with-vm.md)
