# Local build

Two methods are available to run a local build of the `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` site.

* Docker
* Virtual Machine
* Docker on Windows Subsystem for Linux

**IMPORTANT** We do **not** recommend installing Ruby and Jekyll on your operating system as gemfile conflicts **will occur**, ESPECIALLY if you've already set up for the old help repository `/molecula/documentation`

## Before you begin

* Set up Git (including user name and password)
* Add SSH keys to your GitHub account
* Request Read/Write access to `featurebase/featurebase-docs` if you do not already have it
* Clone `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` repository
