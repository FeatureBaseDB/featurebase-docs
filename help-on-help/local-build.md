# Local build

Two methods are available to run a local build of the `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` site.

* Docker
* Virtual Machine

NOTE: You **can** install locally if desired, however this is **not** recommended because Ruby gem conflicts will occur if you:
* have an existing Ruby/Jekyll setup
* intend to setup additional Ruby/Jekyll sites on your local machine

## Before you begin

* Setup Git (including user name and password)
* Add SSH keys to your GitHub account
* Request Read/Write access to `featurebase/featurebase-docs` if you do not already have it
* Clone `/featurebaseDB/featurebase-docs` repository

## Local build using Docker

* [local build with docker](/help-on-help/local-build-with-docker.md)

## Local build using a Virtual Machine

* [local build with VM](/help-on-help/local-build-with-vm.md)
