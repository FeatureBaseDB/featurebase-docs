## What is FeatureBase?

FeatureBase is a feature-oriented database platform that powers real-time analytics and machine learning applications by executing low-latency, high-throughput, and highly concurrent workloads. Similar to the evolution of data formats from row-oriented to columnar, FeatureBase further evolves columnar into a feature-oriented format that makes each distinct data value individually addressable (accessible, readable, writable and retrievable).

FeatureBase is similar to a columnar store, but breaks each column into each of its unique values so that they can be represented as a single bit. This data representation is excellent for a variety of analytical workloads.

Our novel approach minimizes I/O on queries by allowing the database engine to read and write exactly the data it needs and intelligently compress that data in memory. The result is a step-function improvement in analytical workloads.
