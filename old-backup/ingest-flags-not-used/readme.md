# Old ingest flags

Flags were reviewed in 2023-01 by Matt Jaffee and LJ Sinclair.

Information saved to this folder describes ingest flags that are:
* not being used anymore
* developer review/developer only

These flags DO NOT APPEAR in `/docs/community/com-ingest/com-ingest-flag...` files but I've saved them in this folder as a backup

As with everything under /old-backup, this content does NOT build into help
