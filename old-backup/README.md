# Backups -- ignored by Jekyll build

I want to keep these files in backup JUST IN CASE there's any unexpected errors with the Kafka ingest docs because these were a nightmare to put together.

I propose to keep these for at least a couple of months until we've run the new kafka docs under the microscope.
